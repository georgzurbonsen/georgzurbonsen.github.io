<h4> Merging information from different sources</h4>
<p>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Your organization has more than 25 branch offices in various countries around the world.  You are requesting product forecasts
from them in regular time intervals.    Because every office is using different systems to store and manage their data,
you will likely receive the information in different formats.  Past attempts asking them to harmonize their systems did not
work because the switchover costs appeared too high.  Some are database exports, and others are hand-crafted
Excel tables.

<br><br>

<b>The Solution</b>
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Use different short B4P program routines to read the different data from every branch office
</li><li class="bullets">Automatically check for any inconsistencies, especially if data is provided in hand-made Excel sheets
</li><li class="bullets">Align the data using common header names, e.g. 'Customer Name', 'Deliery Date', etc.
</li><li class="bullets">Merge the data from the different sites
</li><li class="bullets">Notify you if two sites start dealing with the same customer
</li><li class="bullets">Consolidate and aggregate all forecast data according to your specifications
</li><li class="bullets">Add formatting, colors and style to make the report easy to use
</li><li class="bullets">Save the final report.
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<h4> Transfer from Machine to Machine</h4>
<p>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
You want to automate the information exchange between your ERP system (Enterprise Resource Planning) and the web-base
CRM system (Customer Relationship Management).  Both systems provide means to upload and downlaod data with commands,
so you can automate the data exchange entirely.  You want to be notified on discrepancies discovered in both databases
which require manual alignment involving the sales managers.

<br><br>

<b>The Solution</b>
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Let B4P initiate the data exports from both CRM and ERP systems
</li><li class="bullets">Check if the customer data and opportunities are matching with each other.  Inform about new customers and opportunities.
</li><li class="bullets">Check consistencies of key dates, for example planned order date.  Consider correcting minor differences (e.g. 1 week or less) automatically or notify sales to check the data
</li><li class="bullets">Refer to a foreign exchange information from a website in case the opportunities are valued in a different currency
</li><li class="bullets">Do necessary format conversions, such as numeric format (One generates EUR values, the other requires them in k EUR, etc.)
</li><li class="bullets">Initiate the data uploads into the ERP and CRM systems respectively
</li><li class="bullets">Generate a report with transactions made and issues requiring attention by sales management.
</li></ul><p>

</p>
<h4> Analyzing Stock Market Data</h4>
<p>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Do the best with your savings by investing your money in a smart way better than others do.  You have identified multiple web pages which provide
structured corporate information such as
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Stock market data (in HTML format)
</li><li class="bullets">Credit rating information (e.g. from rating agencies like Standard and Poors)
</li><li class="bullets">Financial data of selected businesses (compiled in Excel files you can download)
</li></ul><p>With all the infomation, you have a neat appraoch to make up you own idea whether the shares are fairly valued, overvalued
or undervalued, so you your own decision base available whether to intiate buying or selling shares.

<br><br>

<b>The Solution</b>
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Let download all stock market data on a daily base, as well as credit rating info and othe data.
</li><li class="bullets">Align the data to the company names, making sure no mistakes happen with similarly named businesses.  Use their symbol names as a common key.
</li><li class="bullets">Provide som accompanying information, e.g. the market areas the businesses are active in (e.g. banking and finance, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, etc.)
</li><li class="bullets">Do some calculation, for example if a business is doing better than the average market
</li><li class="bullets">Condense the analytics to a list which is easy to understand
</li><li class="bullets">Add color, formatting and style to make it even easier to read
</li><li class="bullets">Save the file and start investing.
</li></ul><p>

</p>
<h4> Comparing Bill of Materials for Commonalities</h4>
<p>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
Your enterprise has developed lots of different products which have similarities to a certain extent.  After some time, you have sufficient sales
data available for the different products so you can do a cross-product analysis by checking for commonalities of the components and pre-assembly
units used.  The engineers have provided a large number (200+) of bill of materials (part lists) for the various products, each of them listing
several thousand parts.  You want to identify the commonalities (i.e. same or similar parts used)
among the product variants, and weigh them up with the number of products sold, in order to initiate some strategic improvements in the product portfolio
in order to optimize operational efficiency and profitability.

<b>The Solution</b>
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Use a simple statement to identify all bill of material files (do not name them individually in your program)
</li><li class="bullets">Load one file after the other and apply relational algebraic operations (e.g. intersections) in order to spot commonalities
</li><li class="bullets">Identify individual parts and similar pre-assembly units used frequently
</li><li class="bullets">Consolidate the information to an abstraction level you can use a a decision base
</li><li class="bullets">Add format, style and save the work.
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<h4> Writing the Programs to Solve these Problems</h4>
<p>
B4P is predestined to let you <b>focus on the 'what'</b>, and hot 'how'.  The philosophy with this language is to express the
steps briefly, with very few smart statements and using loops and variables as little as possible.  A large <a class="bold_text" href="LIB_Features_Function_Library.html">function library</a> is available
to provide various means to solve your data processing solutions efficiently.
