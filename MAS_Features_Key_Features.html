<h4> Key Benefits</h4>
<p>
The overall intention is to provide a tool for you which helps to solve sophisticated problems with large amounts of data involved:
</p><ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets"><b>Simple</b> procedural language easy to read, understand and lear.
</li><li class="bullets">Powerful langauge semantics <b>minimizes the number of statements</b> needed to solve the problem.
</li><li class="bullets"><b>Tables</b> of any size are one of the main data storage models and B4P is optimized for this
</li><li class="bullets"><b>No programming bureaucracy</b> such as declaring all the variables you need.
</li><li class="bullets">Significantly less need for <i>fine grained</i> programming like formulating loops, detailed algorithms, etc.
</li><li class="bullets">B4P understands data formats such as <b>Excel, HTML, XML, JSON, CSV</b>, etc. to retrieve data from Excel, database and the Internet directly
</li><li class="bullets">Extremely <b>flexible in naming</b> variables, tables, functions, procedures, etc. (natural language).
</li><li class="bullets">The B4P Data Engine and all libary files are very lean, very robust and start quickly.
<ul class="bullets"><li class="bullets">Powerful table processing functions available such as merging, consolidating and applying pivots on tables
</li><li class="bullets">Powerful vector and matrix operations available for high-performance calculations on your tables and data
</li></ul></li><li class="bullets">High focus on <b>cross-platform portability</b> (Windows, LINUX, etc.), enabling to run the same B4P program on different platforms.
</li></ul><p>
You will get to full speed quickly if you have some basic programming experience with a high level programming language or a macro
language such as Visual Basic inside Excel.  B4P requires no knowledge about object oriented programming and specific algorithms to manage
big data (e.g. indexing).  The syntax is, even though looking differently from other langauges, incredibly easy to understand and to use.
In contrast to other programming langages, much fewer statements and time are needed, no additional libraries need to be installed
separately (like Panda for Python) and you experience unparalleled machine performance, forgetting the fact that B4P is an interpreted language.

</p>
<h4> No Graphic Gadgets</h4>
<p>
Intentionally, B4P does not make use of any visual features such as graphical user interfaces.  For visualization purposes, powerful
and highly standardized tools such as Microsoft Excel providie all features to do the visualziation, creating all required charts, etc.
to round up you presentation.   The philosophy of B4P is to do all data processing first and very rapidly, and creating final Excel files
for visualization purposes.

<br><br>
However, B4P is able to save tables into Excel files, with multiple sheets in one workbook, and, if needed, some formatting and styling already
included (e.g. column widths, fonts, colors, number formats, autofilter, freezing panes, etc.).</p>
